# DiscordRoleBot
### This is a Discord Role Bot that is used for automatically assigning a role to a user on entry of a server. 

### Also the bot expects an ID value from them once they join into a restricted server channel that only new people can see into and out of. Which is something a server Admin will require to set up and is shown how in the Admin Instructions.

### Once that ID is verified with the CSV file that holds all ID values (generated by the client or admin) the Discord user is given the correct roles and name in line with the CSV file given.

### Additionally this is used as a multi-purpose role bot, including:
### -Reaction Roles! Utilising button based role assignment slash commands!

## 4. You're done!

Ensure you follow the steps for any future channels you make similarly by ensuring only members can see into the channel and @everyone can't see into it. Making new users HAVE to accept the stipulations of your entry system.

Also ensure the bots role "RoleBot" is above all other roles you want it to interact with otherwise it will be unable to assign it!

In order to make the admin role work ensure you make an Admin role and give them the permission "Administrator" within the settings.
